## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot about basic css properties like margin, padding, sizing elements, and how to move orient elements around a page using flexbox.

### Continued development

Want to improve quality on lower screen size. Right now it is responsive down to around 375 px wide and 800px tall. I would like to have the font shrink and possibly remove some elements after that point so the QR code is the main focus.

### Useful resources

- [How to make footer stick to bottom of page](https://dev.to/nehalahmadkhan/how-to-make-footer-stick-to-bottom-of-web-page-3i14) - This helped me figure out how to use flexbox to get the bottom text to stay on the bottom of the screen.
